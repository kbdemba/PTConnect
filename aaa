Designing bootstrap buttons

if not finished
make the home page a carousel, to be moving with different backgrounds

todays Goal
MONDAY
take care of the middleware Please ------------incomplete
Make sure all the middlewares are working --------------incomplete
Teachers then Parents
populate all the views with the right data

Black Friday-- Buy stuffs for the Micro Greens



messages:
In messages, test and see how the author.id works
https://github.com/vithalreddy/nodeJS-socketIO-chat-app/blob/master/app/models/chat.js

anytime you have a new message, it creates a new conversation and adds it
to the user/s model, with the conversation id.

goals tomorrow

make a side nav for the messages link
you should have a parent Partial header and a teacher Partial header
make a hover effect on the list of students AND render them by LocalStrategy

Tommorow PROGRESS
if a teacher logs in, s/he will see all the students in her classroom in a list
each individual will have an anchor link that will take them to their dashboard
or on the list it self, there will be a radio button to show if they are good or bad this is like a form to change the behavior

Y dont you make the className in Parent and maybe teacher reference the actual classs id rather than
just a string saying grade1. THINK

// async function finalSeed(){
//   await seedDB();
// } look how to solve this problem with the async and wait functions

if its a teacher, then she will be able to turn it to green or red or yellow
if its a parent, he/she will only see the color

then their will be a message/comment section at the buttom

#my-div {
    height:100vh; /*vh stands for view-port height, 1vh is 1% of screen height*/
}

HOW IT WORKS VO
// you are the headmaster
// add students and a teacher to a class
// create a user for both students and a teacher
========================================================================
how they communicate 85% COMPLETE

========================================================================
then do the middleware

========================================================================

VERY NEAR FUTURE BEFORE V2
add icons on input fields
THIS APP IS ONLY FOR NURSERY TO Nursery Schools;

make this app send text messages to parents

make Ajax calls when a message is rendered
let the master be able to see the usernames
reset password will be done later


you should watch how they set up a message model
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_chat.asp
text design
all the messages are stored in the parent model, that will have a user ie to know if the role is teacher or
or parent so when it comes to the design
your messaging system is wack, that is the same way u saved it in the database or whatever makes scence to you

home route checks to see if a user is logged in, if not then it renders the normal homepage
else, it takes you to your dashboard


Should it be parent or student (in Models)
if they log in, let that be handle in the index / route, it will check and see if they are logged in,
then check if its a teacher or parent, then redirects them to their respective places
Questions to Ask
1- how much grrade levels do we have in KG OR ELEMENTRY SCHOOL

make user available to all the views
// let teacher have an id then a Name at the user in model like the comment so it can be easy to track

  VERSION 2         VERSION 2       VERSION 2       VERSION 2 Name it KONEK ptvibe for the one looks like facebook
what happens if you log in as a teacher when you have the credentials of a parent
    log them out immidiately
    and flash them that no teacher found with that userName,
    Mayb if the want to try to login as a parent
validate all the inputs
MASTER CAN SEE ALL THE TEACHERS AND STUDENTS AND CLASSES
HE CAN ALSO EDIT ALL OF THEM

Server side validation incase they use postman
After you can DRY in your code

POPULATE ALL THE MESSAGES AND SHOW THE LAST 10 AND HIDE THE REST, IF SHOW MORE IS CLICKED,
SHOW ANOTHER 10, AND SO ON. IF THERE ARE NO MORE MESSAGES, JUST PUT NO MORE MESSAGES - MAKE A LIBRARY OF THIS

Make the message display better

Thorough FORM VALIDATION in select of Student behavior

Make a radio button to select the students that acted good and there should be something at
the top to indicate what you are selecting, eg if its good, naughty, or needToTalk

put the select to select the grade level - MAYB IMPOSSIBLE FOR NOW, V2
